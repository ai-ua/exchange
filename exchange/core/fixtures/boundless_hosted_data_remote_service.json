      "description": "Derives from Mile High Club, a detailed GIS compilation of world wide airports that is in the public domain.  The “location” column is based on the above Airport infrastructure diagram (Source: Wikipedia). Location values Ordered best to worst Terminal – Passenger terminal (not freight, not commercial or private pilot hangers). If there is more than one terminal building, the International Terminal, followed by Terminal 1, or the largest/central building. If multiple terminals are dispersed, the centroid between them is used (often in a parking lot or round about area). See London Heathrow for example. The military terminal is not preferred at joint civilian airports. Parking – If terminals are spread out, use the centroid between them. Most often a parking lot. Ramp – Pavement area outside the passenger terminal area. Used when terminal building is not clear on airphoto interpretation. Runway – Center of the runway. If more than one runway, the centroid. Some of these need nudging over to the centroid. Can include taxiways if difficult to distinguish between runway and taxiway on airphoto interpretation. Approximate – Could be up to 20 miles away from the actual airport location. More often it's within a mile of the actual location. Accuracy is low due to geocoding based on town name, use of DD.DD° or DD.DDDD° format instead of DD.DDDDDD° for latitude and longitude values."

The ocean coastline, the foundation for building all of NEV, primarily derives from World Data Bank 2 with modest generalization applied via line simplification in Adobe Illustrator. The Antarctica coast derives from NASA Mosaic of Antarctica.  Yucatan peninsula, Cuba, and Hispaniola. Issues: World Data Bank 2 coastlines have suspect accuracy for certain parts of the world, including northern Russia, southern Chile, and most egregiously, the west coast of the United States extending to the Baja Peninsula, Mexico, where the coast was approximately 7 km east of where it should be. The west coast of the US was corrected on NEV; other areas were not.  Does not include rank 6, 7, or 8 coastlines from the minor islands. Some rank 5 coastline should be reclassified as rank 6."

Data primarily derives from Catchment Characterisation and Modelling (CCM) Database 2.1 by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Environment and Sustainability. For information about this product and the source data, see http://ccm.jrc.ec.europa.eu.  The modified CCM rivers and lakes offered here are intended for small-scale cartographic use. Only a portion of CCM data is used, representing major rivers and lakes (classes 4 and 5 in the MAINDRAIN attributes column). Generalization and smoothing were applied to these selected data—the CCM vectors contain 9 percent of the data points found in the original source data.  Seamlessly merging CCM rivers and lakes with the existing Natural Earth base data required many adjustments. CCM rivers that coincided with Natural Earth rivers were mostly deleted. In a few cases where the existing Natural Earth data were found egregiously incorrect, the CCM data replaced the Natural Earth data.  The remaining CCM data were fitted Natural Earth rivers, lakes, coastlines, glaciers, political boundaries, and shaded relief derived from SRTM Plus. The positional adjustments were minor given the 1:10 million-scale of the data. In addition, the headwaters of some CCM rivers were clipped slightly downstream to provide visual separation with other river headwaters and to avoid the crests of ridges on the shaded relief.

Ranked by relative importance. Includes name and line width attributes for creating tapered drainages.  Data primarily derives from Catchment Characterisation and Modelling (CCM) Database 2.1 by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Environment and Sustainability. For information about this product and the source data, see http://ccm.jrc.ec.europa.eu.  The modified CCM rivers and lakes offered here are intended for small-scale cartographic use. Only a portion of CCM data is used, representing major rivers and lakes (classes 4 and 5 in the MAINDRAIN attributes column). Generalization and smoothing were applied to these selected data—the CCM vectors contain 9 percent of the data points found in the original source data.  Seamlessly merging CCM rivers and lakes with the existing Natural Earth base data required many adjustments. CCM rivers that coincided with Natural Earth rivers were mostly deleted. In a few cases where the existing Natural Earth data were found egregiously incorrect, the CCM data replaced the Natural Earth data.  The remaining CCM data were fitted Natural Earth rivers, lakes, coastlines, glaciers, political boundaries, and shaded relief derived from SRTM Plus. The positional adjustments were minor given the 1:10 million-scale of the data. In addition, the headwaters of some CCM rivers were clipped slightly downstream to provide visual separation with other river headwaters and to avoid the crests of ridges on the shaded relief.  River and lake name attributes derive from the CCM. Natural Earth contributors assigned the other attributes, including Stroke Weight, Feature Class, Scale Rank, and Feature Number.

The “basic” rivers work well at scales to about 1:30,000,000, good for maps that need to include rives as a general reference mixed with other data themes. If your map is about rivers in particular, or is at 1:5 million to 1:20m scale, add Natural Earth’s “supplementary” river data, now available for North America and Europe only.  The supplemental data provides four times the number of features, at the same level of generalization as the “basic” feature set. The North America supplement includes river tapering (thanks Preston!). The Europe supplement does not (we can show you how)."

Another of their sources was King, G. Q. in unpublished Material: “Late Pleistocene lakes and glaciers of the Great Basin” by Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology in 1975. Digitized the King map and added this to the Nevada map. Added a few lakes not on NBMG Bulletin 94.

The “location” column is based on the above Airport infrastructure diagram (Source: Wikipedia). Location values Ordered best to worst Terminal – Passenger terminal (not freight, not commercial or private pilot hangers). If there is more than one terminal building, the International Terminal, followed by Terminal 1, or the largest/central building. If multiple terminals are dispersed, the centroid between them is used (often in a parking lot or round about area). See London Heathrow for example. The military terminal is not preferred at joint civilian airports. Parking – If terminals are spread out, use the centroid between them. Most often a parking lot. Ramp – Pavement area outside the passenger terminal area. Used when terminal building is not clear on airphoto interpretation. Runway – Center of the runway. If more than one runway, the centroid. Some of these need nudging over to the centroid. Can include taxiways if difficult to distinguish between runway and taxiway on airphoto interpretation. Approximate – Could be up to 20 miles away from the actual airport location. More often it's within a mile of the actual location. Accuracy is low due to geocoding based on town name, use of DD.DD° or DD.DDDD° format instead of DD.DDDDDD° for latitude and longitude values."

Another of their sources was King, G. Q. in unpublished Material: “Late Pleistocene lakes and glaciers of the Great Basin” by Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology in 1975. Digitized the King map and added this to the Nevada map. Added a few lakes not on NBMG Bulletin 94.

The GNIS contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries.  The database assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as the only standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. The GNIS collects data from a broad program of partnerships with Federal, State, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors, and provides data to all levels of government, to the public, and to numerous applications through a web query site, web map and feature services, and file download services."
